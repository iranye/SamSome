AF
Atrial Fibrillation: an irregular and often rapid heart rate causing poor blood flow.  Atria are mis-coordinated with Ventricles.

Arrythmia
Occurs when electrical impulses mis-fire, causing the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly.  Often harmless.

Asystole
Absence of heartbeat, cardiac arrest

Atria
The heart's two upper chambers

AHA
American Heart Association

Bigeminy
When normal sinus beats alternate with premature ventricular beats

Bradycardia
A heartbeat that is too slow

HRV
Heart Rate Variablilty

HVR
High Ventricular Rate

HVRR
High Ventricular Rate Reduction

Myocardial Ischemia
Occurs when blood flow to the heart is decreased by a partial or complete blockage of an artery

PVC
Premature Ventricular Contraction

Refractory Period
The amount of time it takes for an excitable membrane to be ready for a second stimulus once it returns to its resting state following an excitation.

Sinus Node or Sinoatrial
The group of cells where the heart's electrical signal begins

Tachycardia
A heartbeat that is too fast.

Trigeminy
A cardiac arrhythmia characterized by the occurrence of three heartbeats in a repeating pattern: two normal beats coupled to an ectopic beat, or two ectopic beats coupled to a normal beat

Ventricles
The heart's two lower chambers

VFL
Ventricular Flutter
