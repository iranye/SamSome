Testing deck program:
- against normal deck operations e.g., deal cards (with fail condition of too many players)

Design patterns:
- Singleton
- Factory

- Drills:
  - Stuff that's on my resume
  - Foundation:
    - C# type-system,.Net Framework,CLR
  - Core Framework:
    - LINQ, XML, Networking, Regex, Parellelism, extension methods
  - Applied Technology:
    - ASP.NET (MVC)
  - Concepts:  
    - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
    - 

The C# type-system is:
  - unified: all types ultimately share a common base type.
  - type-safe: instances of types can interact only through allowable protocols
  - statically typed (albeit with dynamic typing in 4.0), which means types are checked at compile-time rather than run-time.

The .Net Framework is made up of:
  - The CLR, which provides a language-neutral platform including: 
    - The runtime for executing Managed Code (Intermediate Language (IL), in an assembly or exe).
    - When the CLR loads an assembly, the IL is converted into native code (e.g., x86) via the JIT compiler.
    - The garbage collector
    - Static (Compile-time) type-checking (e.g., fail on: int x = "5") and runtime type-checking (e.g., when down-casting)
  - Libraries, some examples are:
    - System.dll
    - System.Xml.dll
    - System.Core.dll
