Panorama is the web client for managing MTG Decks.

*** Features *** 
Ability to add Notes for when a deck fails (e.g., Failed to draw any creatures in 5 turns).
Correlate cards that are known good combinations.

*** Current Status ***
UnitTestWeb has a unit test that reads card-names from a massaged xml (starting from a dek file).
For each card read, it searches gatherer and saves a jpg file of the image to a test directory (C:\Temp\UnitTestingWeb).
