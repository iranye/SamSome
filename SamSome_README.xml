    <Panorama name="MTGO Deck Tool">
        Front End:
            Deck View should mimic Deck Lists available (e.g., for Commander Decks).
            Use on-demand image-fetching (e.g., via Node) and cacheing of card images.
            Want to provide support for a card scoring system based on certain criteria:
                How well it works with other cards
        Card Image Scraping:
            Currently, card images can be scraped via Unit Test.
            Also want:
                Transformed image
                Database storage:
                    Card Type(s)
                    Expansion(s)
                    Format (e.g., Modern, Standard)
