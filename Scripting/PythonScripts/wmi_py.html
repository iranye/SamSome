wmi - a lightweight Python wrapper around Microsoft's WMI interface

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is Microsoft's answer to
the DMTF's Common Information Model. It allows you to query just
about any conceivable piece of information from any computer which
is running the necessary agent and over which have you the
necessary authority.

The implementation is by means of COM/DCOM and most of the examples
assume you're running one of Microsoft's scripting technologies.
Fortunately, Mark Hammond's pywin32 has pretty much all you need
for a workable Python adaptation. I haven't tried any of the fancier
stuff like Async calls and so on, so I don't know if they'd work.

Since the COM implementation doesn't give much away to Python
programmers, I've wrapped it in some lightweight classes with
some getattr / setattr magic to ease the way. In particular:

<ul>
<li>
The _wmi_namespace object itself will determine its classes
and allow you to return all instances of any of them by
using its name as an attribute. As an additional shortcut,
you needn't specify the Win32_; if the first lookup fails
it will try again with a Win32_ on the front:

<pre class="code">
disks = wmi.WMI ().Win32_LogicalDisk ()
</pre>

In addition, you can specify what would become the WHERE clause
as keyword parameters:

<pre class="code">
fixed_disks = wmi.WMI ().Win32_LogicalDisk (DriveType = 3)
</pre>
</li>

<li>
The objects returned by a WMI lookup are wrapped in a Python
class which determines their methods and classes and allows
you to access them as though they were Python classes. The
methods only allow named parameters.

<pre class="code">
for p in wmi.WMI ().Win32_Process ():
  if p.Name.lower () == 'notepad.exe':
    p.Terminate (Result=1)
</pre>
</li>

<li>
 Doing a print on one of the WMI objects will result in its
 GetObjectText_ method being called, which usually produces
 a meaningful printout of current values.
 The repr of the object will include its full WMI path,
 which lets you get directly to it if you need to.
</li>

<li>
You can get the associators and references of an object as
 a list of python objects by calling the associators () and
 references () methods on a WMI Python object.
 NB Don't do this on a Win32_ComputerSystem object; it will
 take all day and kill your machine!

<pre class="code">
for p in wmi.WMI ().Win32_Process ():
  if p.Name.lower () == 'notepad.exe':
    for r in p.references ():
      print r.Name
</pre>
</li>

<li>
WMI classes (as opposed to instances) are first-class
objects, so you can get hold of a class, and call
its methods or set up a watch against it.

<pre class="code">
process = wmi.WMI ().Win32_Process
process.Create (CommandLine="notepad.exe")
</pre>

</li>

<li>
To make it easier to use in embedded systems and py2exe-style
executable wrappers, the module will not force early Dispatch.
To do this, it uses a handy hack by Thomas Heller for easy access
to constants.
</li>

<li>
Typical usage will be:

<pre class="code">
import wmi

vodev1 = wmi.WMI ("vodev1")
for disk in vodev1.Win32_LogicalDisk ():
  if disk.DriveType == 3:
    space = 100 * long (disk.FreeSpace) / long (disk.Size)
    print "%s has %d%% free" % (disk.Name, space)
</pre>
</li>

</ul>

Many thanks, obviously to Mark Hammond for creating the win32all
extensions, but also to Alex Martelli and Roger Upole, whose
c.l.py postings pointed me in the right direction.
Thanks especially in release 1.2 to Paul Tiemann for his code
contributions and robust testing.
